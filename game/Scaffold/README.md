Scaffold
========

A simple game framework with the basic functionality like managing
states, loading images, handling input and basic structures.

Currently the project is in the form of an app rather than in the
form of a library. 

Dependencies
------------
# Gnu/Linux

SDL2, SDL2-image, SDL2-ttf

# Windows
SDL2, SDL2-image, SDL2-ttf for building. No dependencies to run the
pre-built project. 


Install
-------

Both, on Windows and Gnu/Linux: run scons in the root directory of the
project.
