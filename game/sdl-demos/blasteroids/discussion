<manyglaciers> Hi. What is the allegro way of moving an object to the
	       direction indicated by a variable which determines to what
	       direction the object is heading. This variable can take values
	       from -PI to PI  [11:58]
<tdammers> not allegro specific  [12:10]
<tdammers> you transform the movement vector from polar coordinates (angle and
	   velocity) to carthesian (x and y velocity)
<tdammers> then you multiply that movement vector by the time delta
<tdammers> and add it to the object's position\
<tdammers> so something like object.x += object.velocity * cos(object.angle) *
	   deltat; object.y += object.velocity * sin(object.angle) * deltat;
								        [12:11]
<tdammers> (-PI ... PI is already radians, so you don't need to convert it for
	   the trigonometric functions)  [12:12]
