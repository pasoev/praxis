Blasteroids

A simple implementation of the classic Blasteroids game. This game is
a work in progress.

Building
--------

Depends only on Allegro Game Programming Library
(http://alleg.sourceforge.net/) and its addons, which most probably
are installed along with it.

On Gnu systems, just run:

make

Other systems
-------------

It should be possible to build Blasteroids on Windows with MinGW. 

You might have to remove redundant W flags from the Makefile to get
the program built with Clang on Mac OS X.

In future it will be possible to cross-build this program for
Rockbox-running media devices, as well as mobile devices.
